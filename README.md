Project Overview:
Modern users save dozens of links daily across browsers, devices, and platforms. Clutter aims to reduce this fragmentation by providing a single place to manage links with metadata such as tags, notes, and usage insights.

The application includes:
* A clean authentication flow (login/signup)
* A protected user dashboard
* Link management features
* Activity and usage metrics (designed for backend-driven data)

Key Features
User Authentication:
* Login and signup flow
* Designed to integrate with secure backend authentication (JWT/session-based)

Dashboard Interface:
* Personalized user greeting
* Overview metrics (total links, tags used, starred links, activity score)
* Dashboard layout optimized for scalability

Link Management:
* Save links with titles, tags, and notes
* Designed for CRUD operations via backend APIs

Clean UI Architecture:
* Modular page structure
* Clear separation between authentication pages and dashboard pages
